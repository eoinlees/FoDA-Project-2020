# Fundamentals of Data Analytics - Project-2020 
## Eoin Lees - G00387888 - January 2021


The following program is an assignment for the Fundamentals of Data Analytics module in December 2020. 

A total of four tasks were given throughout the semester with a deadline of January 8th 2021

It is run using Jupyter notebooks.

It can be read directly from git hub, however for full functionallity please download and run directly from your desktop. 

### Jupyter notebooks
* Installation
    Visit https://jupyter.org/ and follow instructions to install on your macine
* To Run
    Navigate to the correct folder in the console and type the following command: Jupyter notebooks
    Use the gui provided in the web explorer and select `Project-2020.ipynb`

### Assignment Brief

In this project you must perform and explain simple linear regression using Python
on the `powerproduction` dataset available on Moodle. The goal is to accurately predict
wind turbine `power` output from wind `speed` values using the data set as a basis.
Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the
following items:

    1. Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.
    2. In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
    3. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.

To enhance your submission, you might consider comparing simple linear regression to
other types of regression on this data set. Rest assured, all the above concepts will be
explored in lecture videos and other materials in the coming semester.


### Results

After compiling all of the research and information into the jupyter notebook document I believe I have a much better understanding of what it means to analyise data. It has sparked an interest in statistics that i hope to persue further. I am confident that in future work I will be able to refer back to this document and use it as a starting off point for working on problems.
